	To solve this programmatically, I would first get the 3 time differences and points with std::cin. Next, I would find the shortest distance, then find the lengths of the other distances relative to the shortest one. Then, I would find the distance differences by multiplying each time distance by the speed of sound, 1481 
m/s. After that, I would make two equations of the differences of the distances of two of the points, and set them equal to the actual difference in distance. Finally, I would increase two variables, x and y, by increments of .01, then plug in each increment into the equations to find the most accurate point, before outputting it with std::cout.
