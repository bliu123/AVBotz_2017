	To solve this programmatically, I would first get the 3 time differences and points with std::cin. 
Next, I would find the shortest distance, then find the lengths of the other distances relative to the 
shortest one. Then, I would find the distance differences by multiplying each time distance by the speed of 
sound, 1481 m/s. After that, I would make two equations of the differences of the distances of two of the 
points, and set them equal to the actual difference in distance. Finally, I would increase two variables, 
x and y, by increments of .01, then plug in each increment into the equations to find the most accurate point, 
before outputting it with std::cout.
