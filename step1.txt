	Shared memory is memory that can be accessed by multiple programs at the same time. Pipes use streams to communicate memory from program to program, using the output of one program as the input of another. I would have our programs use shared memory, because our software is made up of many programs. These programs need to all be able to communicate with each other efficiently and simultaneously. If we use pipes for this, then the information can only be processed by two programs at the same time. Thus, shared memory is much more efficient and also less time consuming.
