	Shared memory is memory that can be accessed by multiple programs at the same time. 
Pipes use streams to communicate memory from program to program, using the output of one program 
as the input of another. I would have our programs use shared memory, because our software is made 
up of many programs. These programs need to all be able to communicate with each other efficiently 
and simultaneously. If we use pipes for this, then the information can only be processed by two 
programs at the same time. In addition, if we use pipes then we have to take the time to get each program
to send and receive information from the correct program. Thus, shared memory is much more efficient 
and also less time consuming to use.
